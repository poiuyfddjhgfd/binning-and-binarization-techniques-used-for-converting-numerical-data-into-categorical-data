# Overview

The notebook covers discretization (also known as binning), a process that transforms continuous numerical variables into discrete intervals (bins). This is useful for handling outliers, improving data spread, and preparing data for machine learning models

# Key Sections
1. Introduction to Binning
Binning converts numerical data into categorical data by creating contiguous intervals.

Also referred to as discretization.

2. Why Use Discretization?
Handle outliers.

Improve value spread.

3. Types of Binning
Unsupervised Binning:

Equal Width (Uniform) Binning

Equal Frequency (Quantile) Binning

K-Means Binning

Supervised Binning:

Decision Tree Binning

Custom Binning

4. Unsupervised Binning Techniques
Equal Width Binning:

Divides data into intervals of equal width.

Formula: (max - min) / bins

Benefits: Good for outliers, no change in spread.

Equal Frequency Binning:

Divides data into intervals with equal numbers of data points.

Uses percentiles (e.g., 10th, 20th, etc.).

K-Means Binning:

Uses clustering to define bin boundaries.

5. Supervised Binning
Decision Tree Binning:

Uses decision trees to find optimal split points.

6. Custom Binning
User-defined intervals based on domain knowledge.

Practical Implementation
Dataset
Uses the Titanic dataset (train.csv), focusing on columns: Age, Fare, and Survived.

Steps Covered
Data Loading & Preprocessing:

Load data and handle missing values.

Baseline Model:

Train a DecisionTreeClassifier without binning.

Evaluate accuracy: ~63.6%.

Binning with KBinsDiscretizer:

Apply quantile-based binning to Age and Fare.

Use ColumnTransformer for seamless integration.

Transform training and test data.

Post-Binning Evaluation:

Train the same model on binned data.

Accuracy improves to ~65%.

Cross-Validation:

Compare cross-validated accuracy before and after binning.

Visualization
The notebook includes histograms to compare the distribution of Age and Fare before and after binning.

Demonstrates the effect of different binning strategies (uniform, quantile).

Custom Function
A helper function discretize() is defined to:

Apply binning with specified parameters.

Plot distributions.

Report mean accuracy.

Key Results
Binning improved model accuracy slightly.

Equal frequency (quantile) binning performed better than uniform binning in this case.

Visualizations clearly show how binning redistributes data into discrete intervals.

Technologies Used
Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Scikit-Learn Components:

KBinsDiscretizer

DecisionTreeClassifier

ColumnTransformer

# Conclusion
This notebook is a practical guide to understanding and applying binning techniques for data preprocessing. It demonstrates how discretization can enhance model performance and provides reusable code for real-world applications.
